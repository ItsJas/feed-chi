# Feed Chi

**Chi** is Hungry, but fortunately it's raining food.
Move him around with **Arrow keys** to eat delicious treats...

Note that there will be **bombs** falling as well, so you need to avoid them or the poor cat will die!

##Run the game

After cloning the source files

```
cd feed-chi && love .
```

or just use the executables, use **FeedChi.love** on Linux/macOS and **FeedChi.exe** on Windows.


## Play
* Use the **Arrow keys** to move Chi right or left or to jump.

* If the game is over press the **Spacebar** to start a new game.

## The story

I made this simple game a while ago with Scratch and I wanted to code it in lua/love just for fun!
