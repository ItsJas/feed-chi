## About

**Chi** is Hungry, but fortunately it's raining food.

Move him around with **Arrow keys** to eat delicious treats...

Note that there will be **bombs** falling as well, so you need to avoid them or the poor cat will die! ![alt text](https://github.com/ItsJas/feed-chi/blob/master/images/bombexp.png)

After cloning the source files

```
cd feed-chi && love .

## The story

I made this simple game a while ago with Scratch and I wanted to code it in lua/love just for fun!

P.S. **I designed & sketched** the **Sprites** myself!
